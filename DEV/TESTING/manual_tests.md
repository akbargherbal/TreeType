# Document 1: Targeted Test Suite for Session 6 Fixes

## 🎯 **Session 6 Testing Protocol - Multi-line Token Handling**

**Focus Area:** Verifying that docstrings, comments, and template literals are properly skipped, and that visual artifacts (multiple cursors) are eliminated.

**Assumption:** Basic features from Session 5 are working (cursor movement, reset, stats, error handling).

---

## Test Suite A: Python Multi-line Docstring Handling

### Test A.1: Docstring Auto-Skip

**Steps:**
1. Open render_code.html (Python sample)
2. Type through line 0: `defcalculate_fibonaccinintlist`
3. After typing final `t` in `list`

**Expected:**
- Cursor immediately jumps from line 0 to line 10 (skipping lines 1-9)
- Line 10 has green left border (active indicator)
- Yellow highlight appears on `i` in `if`
- Stats show: Line Progress "11/13" (not "2/13")

**Result:**  ⚠️  
**Notes:**
- Cursor immediately jumps from line 0 to line 10 ✅ 
- Line 10 has green left border (active indicator) ❌ las `t` in line number 1 is still in light blue!
- Yellow highlight appears on `i` in `if`✅
- Stats show: Line Progress "11/13" (not "2/13") actullay 4/13 ✅

I am wondering where did those lines between 1 and 10 go? not that's a flaw; could be white space ignored by tree-sitter - but it's an interesting thing I did not notice until now.

### Test A.2: No Ghost Cursors After Line Skip

**Steps:**
1. Complete line 0 (as in Test A.1)
2. Visually inspect lines 1-9 (the skipped docstring lines)

**Expected:**
- NO yellow highlights on any character in lines 1-9 ✅
- NO blinking underlines on lines 1-9 ✅
- Docstring text appears dimmed/grayed out ⚠️ Actually shown in brown - which is not a bad thing; the most important thing is that user doesn't need to type comments/doc strings.
- Only ONE yellow highlight exists (on line 10) ✅

**Result:**  ✅ 
**Notes:**

---

### Test A.3: Typing Continues Normally After Skip

**Steps:**
1. After landing on line 10, type: `ifn`
2. Continue through line 10: `ifn0`

**Expected:**
- Each character turns green as typed
- Yellow highlight moves forward normally
- No visual artifacts from previous lines
- Line 10 completes and advances to line 11

**Result:**  ✅ 
**Notes:**

---

### Test A.4: Character Count Excludes Docstring

**Steps:**
1. Complete line 0
2. Check "Char Progress" stat when cursor lands on line 10

**Expected:**
- Should show "0/X" (where X is the typeable chars in line 10)
- Should NOT show "159/X" (docstring content length)
- Total typeable chars for entire file should be ~40 (not ~200)

**Result:** ⚠️
**Char Progress shown:**
Please don't make this part of the manual tests; like calculating characters/stats; that's what computers made for not humans!

## Test Suite B: JavaScript Template Literal Handling

### Test B.1: Switch to JavaScript Sample

**Steps:**
1. From Python sample, select "JavaScript" from dropdown
2. Reset (Esc)
3. Type through lines 0-1 normally

**Expected:**
- JavaScript sample loads
- Can type through function declaration and const line
- No errors in console

**Result:**  ✅ 
**Notes:**

---

### Test B.2: Template Literal Auto-Skip

**Context:** JavaScript sample has multi-line template literal at lines 8-12

**Steps:**
1. Type through lines until you reach line 7 (the line before template literal)
2. Complete line 7
3. Observe what happens

**Expected:**
- Cursor skips from line 7 to line 13 (after template literal)
- Lines 8-12 are NOT typeable 
- Template literal content appears dimmed
- No cursor on template literal lines

**Result:** ☐ ⚠️ 
**Actual behavior:**
I really didn't get that; like there were things I was expecting to type from line 9 to 12 inclusive.
but some I didn't type - now that's not a bad thing in itself - I don't see it as a bug; but in the grand scheme of things we were sort of weighing that in the inception phase of the project - like how tree-sitters see multi-line template literals and that sort of things - So we should revisit that part and see if this is a must thing to have if the project to continue or it's just an option - like the whole thing started when we said we'd like to avoid problematic nodes; like multi-docs

### Test B.3: No Multi-Cursor Bug in JavaScript

**Steps:**
1. As you type through JavaScript sample, watch last character of each completed line

**Expected:**
- Last character of completed line turns green (correct state) ❌
- NO yellow highlight remains on completed lines ✅
- NO blinking underline on completed lines ✅
- Only ONE yellow highlight exists at any time ✅

**Result:** ☐ ✅ / ☐ ❌ / ☐ ⚠️  
**If failed, which lines show ghost cursors:** ___________
⚠️

- No issues with type annotations (`:`, `number`, `string`) ✅

**Result:** ☐ ✅ / ☐ ❌ / ☐ ⚠️  
**Notes:**

---

### Test C.2: JSDoc Comment Auto-Skip

**Context:** TypeScript sample has JSDoc comment at lines 6-10

**Steps:**
1. Complete line 5 (line after interface)
2. Observe cursor behavior

**Expected:**
- Cursor jumps from line 5 to line 11 (skipping lines 6-10)
- JSDoc comment lines (/** ... */) are dimmed
- Stats show line 12/17 (not 7/17)
- Can continue typing line 11 (`async function...`)

**Result:** ☐ ✅ / ☐ ❌ / ☐ ⚠️  
**Actual behavior:**
✅
